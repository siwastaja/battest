device = serial port handle
csv_dir = directory to put csv files into
log_dir = directory to put log files into
csv_dlm = csv delimiter
r_int = resistance measurement interval in seconds
r_t1, r_t2, r_t3 = resistance measurement cycle lenghts in seconds: lo curr, hi curr, lo curr
r_low = low voltage limit to inhibit the start of resistance measurement (discharge)
r_hi  = high voltage limit to inhibit the start of resistance measurement (charge)
r_lo_m, r_hi_m = current multipliers for (t1,t3) and t2, respectively. It's recommended that
                 2*r_lo_m + 1*r_hi_m = 3, to get the average current set from command line.
vmin, vmax = if voltage outside these limits, program aborts and shuts output off.
